    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
        I was sitting at home - scared to go outside.<br>
      Watching a movie, to make myself relax.<br>
       But it was a scary movie, so I got even more scared!<br>
      A  sip a cup of hotcholate would be good idea.<br>
      As there was no chocolate around I've started drinking wine!<br>
